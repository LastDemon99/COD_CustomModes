# <a name="key-features"></a>Key Features
- Players cannot choose preset or custom classes. Everyone starts with a Skorpion as a primary weapon and an usp as a secondary weapon.
- The script will use the same dropzone locations, to spawn weapons and perks, there will be a 3 perk slot.
- Once a player picks up a weapon or perk, the fx location turns red, after a time of 30 seconds, then regenerates the same weapon, or 
perk.
- The way to pick up an item is by using the f key, if you don't have the weapon it will be replaced by the one you have in your hand, otherwise it will just fill your ammo, likewise only if you don't have the weapon or perk will you be able to use the item.
- The only available perks are FastReload, QuickDraw, Stalker, Paint, BulletAccuracy, Quieter.
- Players can jump twice the normal height and falling damage is negated, bunnyhop and bounce has enable.
- The script only works for stock maps.

# <a name="how-to-use"></a>How To Use
- Paste the dll in the scripts folder of your server, load the script in your server.cfg file
	>Loadscript "Old_School.dll"
- Another option is rename the dll to Old_School.auto.dll to tekno load it automatically
- Or finally use a rotation that loads and unloads the scripts in rotation [LB_Rotate](https://github.com/LastDemon99/LB_Rotate)

# <a name="download"></a>Download
- The script was made with InfinityScript1.5 to port scripts to 1.1 in a faster way, i made a library, so you need to download and place another file in the script folder, that does not need to be loaded by the server.
